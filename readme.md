![GIF BATTLE](./frontend/src/headerImg.png)

A gif based party game made with React and Node.js, and can run on a single server with Docker.

## How to play

- Join a room with your friends and start the game
- Read the prompt
- Search giphy for what you think is the best/funniest/stupidest/smartest reaction
- Add some "meme" text if you want
- Submit
- Pick which of your friend's gifs you like the best
- Score and repeat!

### Some bugs and a to do list

- scoring doubling by accident
- searching doesn’t erase the text in the search bar
- moblie got booted
- need more time on voting
- searching - need to cancel previous search when performing new search & need indicator that theres a current search loading
- “vote: x”
- score = total votes, so everyone can get points at the end of the round
- submit button at top where it can be seen
- waiting on x players to submit
- need placeholder image in search
- one second delay in search not long enough for the slow typers
